Since I was very little I had a passion for technology, playing games and trying to figure out how they worked and how they were created; I can still remember the hours playing Final Fantasy X and trying to understand how that characters could move, how the various event were handled and how everything was so perfectly scripted. During high school I started learning C with the Kernighan Ritchie manual, and learning a bit of C++ and Java as well. During the last two years I also started learning HTML and Blender for 3D art (I was still mesmerized with the beauty of Final Fantasy X and I wanted to be able to create that).

After an initial study in computer engineering, I decided to move into computer science to have the chance to work more on programming projects and have a higher knowledge in languages, algorithms, compilers and the functionalities of the computer architecture.

Even now that passion still lies and I keep learning and studying to improve and I constantly look for challenges and improvement possibilities.

Over the years, I have had the opportunity to work on a variety of programming projects, both academic and personal. These experiences have allowed me to deepen my understanding of software development. I particularly enjoy tackling complex problems and finding elegant solutions, whether it's optimizing code performance or experimenting with new technologies. Currently, I am focused on expanding my skills in web development and data science.

Looking ahead, I am excited to continue growing as a developer and explore emerging fields such as artificial intelligence and cloud computing. My goal is to combine my technical expertise with creativity to build impactful solutions and inspire others to pursue their passion for technology.

About me
======
I am currently a PhD Research Fellow at the University of Oslo, working on Digital Twins for social, environmental and cyber-physical systems in the [Reliable Systems group](https://www.mn.uio.no/ifi/english/research/groups/psy/). My research focuses on applying formal methods and software engineering principles to develop robust and efficient digital representations of real-world systems.

My research focuses on applying different methodologies within different applications domains, to construct self-adaptive systems that can react to changes in the environment and in the system itself. I am particularly interested in the intersection of formal methods, software engineering, and data science, and how these fields can be combined to create innovative solutions for complex problems.
