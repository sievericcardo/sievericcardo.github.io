This is a description of a teaching experience. You can use markdown like any other post.

Course description
======
The core of the course is to define and develop a domain-specific language in Java, using ANTLR for parsing, and a custom interpreter for executing the language.

Course duties
======

In the course I actively helped in defining the teaching content process, defining the set of mandatory assignment alongside the solution and skeleton code for the students, and to monitor and help the teaching assistants that were dealing with the exercise sessions.

Self-reflection
======

The feedback we received from the student was then refined for the following year course and adjusted accordingly. On one hand, some students find it difficult to progress linearly with the project during the course, on the other hand, the more advanced students, find a bit restricting. Following their feedback, we proceeded in adjusting the assignments to have one extra. We used it to split the second assignment into two, making it easier for students to follow through, and to implement the different components more naturally. Conversely, we also let people to have more freedom in the actual implementation, providing the contrasting for the baseline that we required, and by providing hints for students that required them to succeed in the course.
