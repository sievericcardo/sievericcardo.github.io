This is a description of a teaching experience. You can use markdown like any other post.

Course description
======
The core of the course is to define and develop a domain-specific language in Java, using ANTLR for parsing, and a custom interpreter for executing the language.

Course duties
======

In the course I actively helped in defining the teaching content process, defining the set of mandatory assignment alongside the solution and skeleton code for the students, and to monitor and help the teaching assistants that were dealing with the exercise sessions.

Self-reflection
======

Dealing with the creation of the whole project and subdividing it into multiple assignments required several steps from planning the content, to detailing the elements and identify the actionable components for the students to implement. In this regard, the backward design was quite helpful in identify the actionable elements from the bottom-up implementation, subdividing the different assignments using some story for the design of the project. This created a nice narrative for the project to be implemented.
